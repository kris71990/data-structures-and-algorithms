# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Documentation

### Data Structures
Consult the data-structures directory for tested implementations of commonly used data structures:

```
LinkedList
Stack
Queue
Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
K-ary Tree
Hash Map
```

More specific documentation for each data structure can be found in the structure's own directory README.

### Algorithms
Other directories contain various problems solved with the above data structures; a whiteboarded solution to each problem can be found in the README.

#### Testing
`git clone https://github.com/kris71990/data-structures-and-algorithms.git`
`npm i`
`npm run test`
